# Image Watermarking in Frequency Domain (FFT)

This MATLAB project demonstrates how to embed a grayscale watermark into a grayscale image in the frequency domain using 2D FFT.

## Features

- Watermark is added to selected frequency bands (low, mid, high)
- Visual analysis of original vs watermarked spectrum
- Watermark recovery by FFT subtraction
- BONUS: Frequency transform of watermark also used for embedding

## Highlights

- Controlled transparency using alpha coefficient
- Central and corner-positioned watermark embedding
- Real and magnitude visualizations
